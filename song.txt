My name isn't Alice
But I'll keep looking, I'll keep looking for Wonderland
My name isn't Alice
But I'll keep looking, I'll keep looking for Wonderland, Wonderland

Ah-ah-ah-oh, ah-ah-ah
Set me free
Ah-ah-ah-oh, ah-ah-ah
Set me free

Could you pull me out of this alive?
Ah-ah-ah-oh, ah-ah-ah
Where's my body? I'm stuck in my mind
Ah-ah-ah-oh, ah-ah-ah

Oh ma-ma-ma, oh ma-ma-ma
I'm tired of screaming
Oh ma-ma-ma, oh ma-ma-ma
At the top of my lungs
Oh my mother, oh my mother
I'm in the hole, I'm falling down, down, so down, down
